# Performance-Patches
Full patches necessary to perform electronic pieces

When pasted, these codes will generate the complete patches for performance. DSP setup is always available from the GUI.
Be sure to note which modules must be saved in the same folder as the main patch! (They are all available in the Max/MSP
examples repository.) I will be happy to send any additional files (like audio files and pattr preset storage files) that
are not included in the repository. 

Thanks!
